# DA14585/DA14586 Scan Tracking peripheral

---


## Example description

This SDK6 DA14585 example shows how a peripheral device can track if it is scanned and which central device 
performs the scanning procedure.
The scan device needs to scan in active mode since the peripheral device will track if it is scanned using
the scan request that the central will issue to get the scan response data from the peripheral.
The example Requires a minor change in the SDK code, the scan request is tracked in every BLE end event,
the user will have to attach a hook in the BLE end event ISR.
	
## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

	- This example runs on The DA14585/DA14586 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
	- The Basic / Pro Development kit is needed for this example.
	- Connect the USB Development kit to the host computer.
	- UART TX jumper on P0_4

* **Software configuration**

	- This example requires:
    * Smartsnippets Studio 1.6.3.
    * SDK6.0.10
	- **SEGGERâ€™s J-Link** tools should be downloaded and installed.
	- **A simple serial terminal** should be installed on the PC


## How to run the example

For initial setup of the example please refer to [this section of the dialog support portal](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/resource/da1458x-example-setup).

### Initial Setup

 - Start Keil
 - Open file rwble.c
 - Search for the dlg_event_isr() function (line 700)
 - Above dlg_event_isr() function implementation, add the declaration of the hook function "__weak void user_end_event_isr_hook(void) {}"
 - In the dlg_event_isr() function invoke the user_end_event_isr_hook() function before any other SDK function is invoked.
 - Compile and launch the example
 - Open the development kit serial port with the following parameters

		- baudrate: 115200
		- data: 8 bits
		- stop: 1 bit
		- parity: None
		- flow  control: none
 - If the device is activelly scanned then the fw will print the bd addresses that are scanning the device.
 - Also in the case of a scan request a cursor will also appear in the power profiler of Smart Snippets.
