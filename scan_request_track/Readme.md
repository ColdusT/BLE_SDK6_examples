# DA14585/DA14586 Scan Tracking peripheral

---


## Example description

This SDK6 DA14585 / DA14531 example demostrates how a peripheral device can track if it is scanned and which central device 
performs the scanning procedure.
The central device needs to scan in active mode since the peripheral device will track if it is scanned via
the scan request from central.
The example doesn't require any change in the SDK 6.0.12 code as in previous SDK releases, the scan request is tracked in every BLE END event.
	
## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

	- This example runs on The DA14585/DA14586/DA14531 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
	- The Basic / Pro Development kit is needed for this example.
	- Connect the USB Development kit to the host computer.
	- UART TX on P0_4 for DA14585/DA14586
	- UART TX on P0_6 for DA14531
	- For the cursor to operate on DA14531 on the PRO KIT a fly wire is needed connecting P03 with J10.1 pin.

* **Software configuration**

	- This example requires:
    * Smartsnippets Toolbox 2.0.9.
    * SDK6.0.12
	- **SEGGERâ€™s J-Link** tools should be downloaded and installed.
	- **A simple serial terminal** should be installed on the PC


## How to run the example

For initial setup of the example please refer to [this section of the dialog support portal](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/resource/da1458x-example-setup).

### Initial Setup

 - Compile and launch the example
 - Open the development kit serial port with the following parameters

		- baudrate: 115200
		- data: 8 bits
		- stop: 1 bit
		- parity: None
		- flow  control: none
 - If the device is activelly scanned then the fw will print the bd addresses that are scanning the device.

 - Also in the case of a scan request a cursor will also appear in the power profiler of Smart Snippets.
