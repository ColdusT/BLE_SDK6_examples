# DA14531 - DA14585/6 Simple Beacon Example 

------

## Example description

The main purpose of this SW example is to demonstrate creating a **Non-Connectable Advertising** application example. To make Non-Connectable advertising more efficient the ``flag type`` field of an advertising packet is optional (please check **Core Specification Supplement v6 by Bluetooth SIG**). If the ``flag type`` field is not used, it can free up to 3 bytes of space which can then be used for sending more advertising data.

## Non-Connectable Advertising

For getting more information about the Non-Connectable Advertising, please refer to [Advertising Tutorial](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/sites/default/files/advertising_concept.pdf) from our [support website](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/bluetooth-low-energy).

## HW and SW configuration

- **Hardware configuration**
  - This example runs on the DA14531, DA14585, DA14586 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
  - The Basic / Pro Development kit is needed for this example with default jumper configuration..
  - Connect the USB Development kit to the host computer.
- **Software configuration**
  - SmartSnippets Studio v2.0.x.
  - SDK6.0.1x.
  - **SEGGERâ€™s J-Link** tools should be downloaded and installed.
  - A smartphone with a BLE scanning app (for example **BLE scanner** on Android or **Lightblue** on IOS).
  - A BLE Sniffing tool is also useful; though not mandatory .

## How to run the example

### Initial Setup

For the initial setup, please refer to [this section](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/sites/default/files/sw-example-da1458x-example-setup.pdf").

### Compile & Run

- Navigate to ``project_environment`` folder and open the **Keil **project.
- Compile and then launch the demonstration example. You can download the firmware either into System-RAM or SPI Flash. To download the firmware into SPI Flash, the  SPI Flash programmer from SmartSnippets Toolbox should be used. 
- Define the data that is to append into ``Adverting`` or ``Scan Response`` data packet by configuring the **USER_DATA** macro in `user_simple_beacon.h`. By default, **USER_DATA** is defined as follow :

```c
#define USER_DATA  ("DA14585/6 & DA14531 Simple Beacon Software Example")
```

***Note:***
**USER_DATA** are stored in the **uninitialized section of the Retention-RAM**

```c
uint8_t user_store_data[USER_DATA_LEN]            __attribute__((section("retention_mem_area_uninit") , zero_init));  //@RETENTION MEMORY
```

and copied into the `user_store_data[]` array:

```c
memcpy(user_store_data, USER_DATA ,USER_DATA_LEN );
```

- Initially, the device initiates non-connectable advertising (**ADV_NONCONN_IND**) and then proceeds with sending an advertising scan indication (**ADV_SCAN_IND**).  Finally, the device is switched back to non-connectable advertising mode. This is a full loop and is repeated all the time. 
- Initially, the code checks if `user_store_data[]` is not empty. 
- Every time the SW timer elapses, the `adv_data_update_timer_cb()` callback routine is triggered and each element of `user_store_data[]` is stored in the Advertising Data or Scan Response data packet.
- The firmware checks whether the advertising data are full or not. If not, the next item from ``user_store_data[]`` will be appended into them. 
- Once the Advertising data packet is full and given that more data are present in ``user_store_data[]` , the next user data will be stored into the Scan Response data packet (**SCAN_RESP**).

## Known Limitations

- Refer to the following application note for [known hardware limitations](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/system/files/resources/DA1458x-KnownLimitations_2018_02_06.pdf "known hardware limitations").
