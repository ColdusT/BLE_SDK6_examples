# DA14585 - Changing advertising parameters using GPIO interrupts and/or timers

---


## Example description

This SDK6 DA14585 example provides a implementation of a advertising state machine, changing between non-connectible advertising, undirected advertising and sleep state. The advertising state is dependent upon button events by default, but with a simple hash define the user can configure it to be dependent on timers instead. The timings of the states and advertising intervals are pre-compilation configurable as well. The example includes UART messages to a serial console (i.e. Tera Term) and LED indication by turning the LED on during advertising. Both of these options can be turned off if desired.
## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

	- This example runs on The DA14585 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
	- The Basic or pro Development kit is needed for this example.
	- Connect the USB Development kit to the host computer.
	- Button is configured to P1_1 corresponding to SW3 on the Pro Development kit.
		- For the Basic development kit, an active-low switch should be connected to P1_1 as displayed in the schematic underneath
	- The jumper settings are displayed in pink in the schematic underneath. These settings are the same for both the pro and basic development kit.

* **Software configuration**

	- This example requires:
    * Smartsnippets Studio 1.6.3.
    * SDK6.0.10
	- **SEGGERâ€™s J-Link** tools should be downloaded and installed.


## How to run the example

For initial setup of the example please refer to [this](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/resource/da1458x-example-setup) section of the dialog support portal.
The example is running from SRAM. For programming to Flash, see chapter 11 in the [SmartSnippets Toolbox User Manual](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/resource/um-b-083-smartsnippets-toolbox-user-manual).

### Initial Setup

 - Start Keil
 - [Optional] Configure the following parameters at the bottom of the da1458x_config_basic.h file.
 	- Make sure *ADV_EXAMPLE* is defined.
 	- Make sure either *ADV_BUTTON_EXAMPLE* **OR** *ADV_TIMER_EXAMPLE* is defined based on which example is preferred.
 	- Make sure *LED_INDICATION* is defined if this is you preference.
 	- Make sure *CFG_PRINTF*  is defined if UART messages are desired.


 - [Optional] Configure the following parameters in the advertising_example.h files
 	- Set *UNDIRECT_ADV_INTERVAL* to the desired value in milliseconds to configure the undirected advertising interval.
 	- Set *NONCONN_ADV_INTERVAL* to the desired value in milliseconds to configure the non-connectible advertising interval.
 	- Set *UNDIRECT_ADV_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the duration of the undirected advertising in the timer based example.
 	- Set *NONCONN_ADV_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the duration of the non-connectible advertising in the timer based example.
 	- Set *SLEEP_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the sleep duration in the timer based example.


 - Compile and launch the example

 - [Optional] Open the serial terminal of your choice (i.e. Tera Term) with the following parameters.
	- baud rate: 115200
	- data: 8 bits
	- stop: 1 bit
	- parity: None
	- flow  control: none

- If *ADV_BUTTON_EXAMPLE* is defined (default), the example will switch states based on button events like shown in the diagram below. In order to differentiate from a long and a short button press in this example a three second timer is started on the positive edge. If the timer expires, a flag will be set, indicating a long button press. Upon button release, the timer will be terminated if it is still running. After this a check will detect if the flag is set or not and determine the state accordingly.

- if *ADV_TIMER_EXAMPLE* is defined, the example will switch states based on timer events like shown in the diagram below. Upon initiating advertising, a timer is started with a registered callback to update the advertising parameters. In this example however, the callback, instead of updating the parameters, will activate the next state.

### About this example
Starting point for this example is the BLE barebone project from SDK6. This provides the right framework for the advertising events used in this example.
-	The user_advertising_example header and source file, which contain most of the functionality of this example, were added.
- Some slight changes were made in the user_barebone.c and user_barebone.h files. These changes can be easily traced as they are marked with the ADV_EXAMPLE flag.
- Some minor changes were made to the user_peripheral_setup files to accommodate the button functionality and led indication.
- The user_callback_config.h has been slightly modified. Callback is added for non-connectible advertising as well as a callback to check the last BLE event for the sake of advertising LED indication.
