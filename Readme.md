# Smartbond SDK6 Application Examples

This is the repository storing example for the [DA145xx family](https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/products/interface-connectivity/wireless-communications/bluetooth-low-energy/da14531-smartbond-ultra-low-power-bluetooth-51-system-chip).

For information about the DA145xx platform and how to bring up your development kit, please refer to the [Getting started User Manual](http://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/UM-B-117-DA14531-Getting-Started-With-The-Pro-Development-Kit/index.html)

## Example usage

To run any of these SW examples, the user needs:

- DA14531/DA14585/DA14586 hardware.
- Keil µvision.
- Renesas SDK 6.0.22



1. First, download [the SDK from the Renesas website](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/swo/sdk60221401-da1453x-da145856).  
	_Creating an account and accepting the license agreement are required to download the SDK._
	
2. Enter the projects folder and clone this repository:

	```console
    > cd projects
	> git clone https://github.com/dialog-semiconductor/BLE_SDK6_examples.git
    ```
	
3. Open the project file (.uvprojx) you are interested in in Keil µvision.

4. Select your target:

5. Build the project:

	![Alt text](https://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/UM-B-117-DA14531-Getting-Started-With-The-Pro-Development-Kit/_images/blinky_built.jpg "Build")

6. Run:

**Note**: _It is highly recommended the user creates files that are added in the *src* folder of the SW example. By default, the Python script does not process user files located outside the *src* folder. You are free to create any folder under the *src* user space. You need to make sure the new folder path under *src* is added in the Keil project as a relative path._
