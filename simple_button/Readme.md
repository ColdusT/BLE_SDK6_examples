# DA14585/DA14586 Peripheral GPIO - Simple Button press

---


## Example description

This SDK6 DA14585 example shows how configure a simple button for short press and long press (>3 seconds)
from the applicaiton layer 
As a proof of concept it can be verified by transmitting UART messages or the LED status

## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

	- This example runs on The DA14585 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
	- The Basic / Pro Development kit is needed for this example.
	- Connect the USB Development kit to the host computer.
	- UART TX/RX jumper on P0_4/P0_5
	- LED jumper is configured to P10
	- Button is configured to P1_1 corresponding to SW3 on the Pro Development kit.
	  For the Basic development kit, a active-low switch should be connected to P1_1 as displayed in the following schematic

* **Software configuration**

	- This example requires:
    * Smartsnippets Studio 1.6.3.
    * SDK6.0.10
	- **SEGGERâ€™s J-Link** tools should be downloaded and installed.

## How to run the example

For initial setup of the example please refer to [this section of the dialog support portal](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/resource/da1458x-example-setup).

### Initial Setup

 - Start Keil
 - Compile and launch the example
 - Open the development kit serial port with the following parameters

		- baudrate: 115200
		- data: 8 bits
		- stop: 1 bit
		- parity: None
		- flow  control: none

 - Pressing the button (P1_1) for less than 3 seconds (i.e. short press) to toggle the led status
 - Pressing the button (P1_1) for 3 seconds or more (i.e. long press) will start LED blinking ON/OFF
 - Pressing the button (P1_1) for less than 3 seconds (i.e. short press) again will stop LED blinking or toggle
