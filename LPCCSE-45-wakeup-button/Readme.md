# DA14585/DA14586 Button Press with Wakeup from Sleep

---


## Example description

This SDK6 DA14585 example shows how to configure
multiple buttons that will wakeup the system from
sleep. In the wakeup handler it will detect the source
of the wakeup. When button P0_6 is the source of the
wakeup, the LED P1_0 will turn on. Alternatively, when 
button P1_1 is the source of the wakeup, the LED will 
remain off. In both cases, provided CFG_PRINTF is
defined in the da1458x_config_basic.h, a message will 
be send to the serial terminal (i.e. Tera Term, or any 
other of your own preference) displaying the wakeup source.

## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

	- This example runs on The DA14585 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
	- The Basic or pro Development kit is needed for this example.
	- Connect the USB Development kit to the host computer.
	- When the basic kit is used two pull-down switches need to 
	be connected to P0_6 and P1_1 as shown in the schematic underneath
	- Jumper configuration: SWD pins and UART pins should be connected, 
	for both the Basic and Pro kit, as shown in purple in the schematic 
	underneath.

* **Software configuration**

	- This example requires:
    * Smartsnippets Studio 1.6.3.
    * SDK6.0.10
	- **SEGGERâ€™s J-Link** tools should be downloaded and installed.


## How to run the example

For initial setup of the example please refer to [this section of the dialog support portal](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/resource/da1458x-example-setup). 
The example is running from SRAM. To run the program from flash refer to chapter 11 of the [SmartSnippets Toolbox User Manual](https://support.dialog-semiconductor.com/resource/um-b-083-smartsnippets-toolbox-user-manual).

### Initial Setup

 - Start Keil
 - Compile and launch the example
 - Open the development kit serial port with the following parameters

		- baudrate: 115200
		- data: 8 bits
		- stop: 1 bit
		- parity: None
		- flow  control: none
		
## About this Example
This example was built on top of the Barebone project from SDK6. The code can be found in user_wakeup_example.h and user_wakeup_example.c.
The function, to initialize the parameters of the example, user_wakeup_example_init(void), is called from the user_app_init(void) in the user_barebone.c file.
In the da1458x_config_basic.h file the SLEEP_WITHOUT_ADVERTISING flag is undefined by default. When sleep without advertising is required, defining this flag will ensure this. 

To setup the wakeup interrupt, wkupct_enable_irq(uint32_t sel_pins, uint32_t pol_pins, uint16_t events_num, uint16_t deb_time) from the wkupct_quadec driver is used with the following paramters:

 - 	sel_pins: (WKUPCT_PIN_SELECT(GPIO_BUTTON2_PORT, GPIO_BUTTON2_PIN) | WKUPCT_PIN_SELECT(GPIO_BUTTON_PORT, GPIO_BUTTON_PIN)). WKUPCT_PIN_SELECT uses the GPIO Port and GPIO Pin to create the correct
	bitmask for setting the wakeup interrupt in the corresponding register(s). If more than one interrupt source is to be set, as is the case here, use an OR operation to combine all the bitmasks.
 - 	pol_pins: (WKUPCT_PIN_POLARITY(GPIO_BUTTON2_PORT, GPIO_BUTTON2_PIN, 1) | WKUPCT_PIN_POLARITY(GPIO_BUTTON_PORT, GPIO_BUTTON_PIN, 1)). WKUPCT_PIN_POLARITY uses the GPIO Port, GPIO Pin and polarity parameter to create the correct
	bitmask for setting the polarity of the wakeup source in the corresponding register(s). If more than one interrupt source is to be set, as is the case here, use an OR operation to combine all the bitmasks.
 - 	events_num: (1). The number of wakeup events before an interrupt is triggered ranging from 0 - 255.
 - 	deb_time: (30). The debounce time in miliseconds ranging from 0 - 63 (0x00 - 0x3F).
 
 The wakeup callback is set using the wkupct_register_callback(wakeup_handler_function_t callback) function from the wkupct_quadec driver. In this case it is set to the app_wakeup_press_cb(void).
 
 In the app_wakeup_press_cb(void) the following is done:
 * When the device isn't sleeping, put the device to sleep by calling the following functions:
 
	- app_easy_gap_advertise_stop(); This function will stop the advertising. (Function is only called when the SLEEP_WITHOUT_ADVERTISING is defined)
	- arch_set_sleep_mode(ARCH_EXT_SLEEP_ON); This function will change the default sleepstate.	
	- arch_ble_ext_wakeup_on(); This function prevents the BLE core from waking up the system. Only an external event (i.e. buttonpress) can wake up the system.
	
* When the device is sleeping, wakeup the device by calling the following functions:

	- arch_set_sleep_mode(ARCH_SLEEP_OFF); This will change the default sleepstate.
    - arch_ble_force_wakeup(); This will wakeup the BLE core when only external event can wake up the system. 
    - arch_ble_ext_wakeup_off(); This will enable the BLE core to wakeup the system from sleep.
	- Furthermore, the source of the interrupt will be checked and displayed accordingly. 
	
With the wakeup interrupt there isn't a good way do differentiate between level detection and edge detection 
as is the case with normal GPIO interrupts by setting the correct value in the GPIO_INT_LEVEL_CTRL_REG. 
For the wakeup interrupt there is no similiar register to achieve this result.
